        Hello! Nice to meet you. My name is Yennie Tran. I was born and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana. 
        Currently, I am a Masters student at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University Bloomington studying Information Systems. 
        I run on 2 cups of coffee a day and a lot of curiosity. I enjoy learning new things, trying out new ideas, and acting a bit silly. 
        I also enjoy working with people and turning random ideas into cool working projects! 
        I have also rode an ostrich before. They are quite spiky birds.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is my personal webpage that I created as part of my coursework. 
        Feel free to explore around and learn more about me, my projects, and how to contact me!
